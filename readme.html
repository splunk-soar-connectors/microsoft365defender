    <h2>Explanation of Asset Configuration Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tenant ID - It is the Directory ID of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory on the Microsoft Azure portal.</li>
          <li>Client ID - It is the Application ID of an application configured in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory.</li>
          <li>Client Secret - It is the secret string used by the application to prove its identity when requesting a token. It can be generated for the configured application on the Microsoft Azure Active Directory.</li>
          <li>Non-Interactive Auth - It is used to determine the authentication method. If it is checked then non-Interactive auth will be used otherwise interactive auth will be used. Whenever this checkbox is toggled then the test connectivity action must be run again.</li>

          <li>Click on the 'TEST CONNECTIVITY' button, it should run the test connectivity action without any user interaction.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>Explanation of Test Connectivity Workflow for Interactive auth and Non-Interactive auth</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This app uses (version 1.0) OAUTH 2.0 authorization code workflow APIs for generating the [access_token] and [refresh_token] pairs if the authentication method is interactive else [access_token] if authentication method is non-interactive is used for all the API calls to the Microsoft 365 Defender instance.</li>
          <li>Interactive authentication mechanism is a user-context based workflow and the permissions of the user also matter along with the API permissions set to define the scope and permissions of the generated tokens.</li>
          <li>Non-Interactive authentication mechanism is a user-context based workflow and the permissions of the user also matter along with the API permissions set to define the scope and permissions of the generated token.</li>
          <li>The step-by-step process for the entire authentication mechanism is explained below.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first step is to get an application created in a specific tenant on the Microsoft Azure Active Directory. Generate the [client_secret] for the configured application. The detailed steps have been mentioned in the earlier section.</li>
              <li>Configure the Microsoft 365 Defender app's asset with appropriate values for [tenant_id], [client_id], and [client_secret] configuration parameters.</li>
              <li>Run the test connectivity action for Interactive method.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Internally, the connectivity creates a URL for hitting the /authorize endpoint for the generation of the authorization code and displays it on the connectivity pop-up window. The user is requested to hit this URL in a browser new tab and complete the authorization request successfully resulting in the generation of an authorization code.</li>
                <li>The authorization code generated in the above step is used by the connectivity to make the next API call to generate the [access_token] and [refresh_token] pair. The generated authorization code, [access_token], and [refresh_token] are stored in the state file of the app on the Splunk SOAR server.</li>
                <li>The authorization code can be used only once to generate the pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token]. If the [access_token] expires, then the [refresh_token] is used internally automatically by the application to re-generate the [access_token] by making the corresponding API call. This entire autonomous workflow will seamlessly work until the [refresh_token] does not get expired. Once the [refresh_token] expires, the user will have to run the test connectivity action once again to generate the authorization code followed by the generation of an entirely fresh pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token]. The default expiration time for the [access_token] is 1 hour and that of the [refresh_token] is 90 days.</li>
                <li>The successful run of the Test Connectivity ensures that a valid pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token] has been generated and stored in the app's state file. These tokens will be used in all the actions' execution flow to authorize their API calls to the Microsoft 365 Defender instance.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Run the test connectivity action for Non-Interactive method.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Internally, the application authenticates to Azure AD token issuance endpoint and requests an [access_token] then it will generate the [access_token].</li>
                <li>The [access_token] generated in the above step is used by the test connectivity to make the next API call to verify the [access_token]. The generated [access_token] is stored in the state file of the app on the Splunk SOAR server.</li>
                <li>If the [access_token] expires, then application will automatically re-generate the [access_token] by making the corresponding API call.</li>
                <li>The successful run of the Test Connectivity ensures that a valid [access_token] has been generated and stored in the app's state file. This token will be used in all the actions execution flow to authorize their API calls to the Microsoft 365 Defender instance.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>State file permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Please check the permissions for the state file as mentioned below.
        <h4>State file path</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>For Non-NRI instance: /opt/phantom/local_data/app_states/&lt;appid&gt;/&lt;asset_id&gt;_state.json</li>
          <li>For NRI instance: /&lt;PHANTOM_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/local_data/app_states/&lt;appid&gt;/&lt;asset_id&gt;_state.json</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>State file permissions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>File rights: rw-rw-r-- (664) (The Splunk SOAR user should have read and write access for the state file)</li>
          <li>File owner: Appropriate Splunk SOAR user</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>&lt;appid&gt; - The app ID will be available in the Redirect URI which gets populated in the field 'POST incoming for Microsoft 365 Defender to this location' when the Microsoft 365 Defender app asset is configured e.g. https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/microsoft365defender_&lt;appid&gt;/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result</li>
        <li>&lt;asset_id&gt; - The asset ID will be available on the created asset's Splunk SOAR web URL e.g. https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/apps/&lt;app_number&gt;/asset/&lt;asset_id&gt;/</li>
      </ul>
